# Hair Salon Website Project Report

## Project Overview

This project involved creating a responsive website for a hair salon, addressing the needs of two personas: Joe, a visitor looking for an easy booking process and the ability to view the salon's previous work, and Dexter, a regular client who prefers to book with a specific barber.

## Technologies Used

1. HTML5: Used for structuring the content of the website.
2. CSS3: Used for styling the website, including custom styles and responsive design.
3. Bootstrap 5: Utilized for its responsive grid system and pre-built components.
4. JavaScript: Implemented for dynamic content on the confirmation page.
5. Google Fonts: Incorporated the Poppins font family for a modern look.
6. Unsplash: Used for high-quality, royalty-free images.
7. Font Awesome: Used for icons.
